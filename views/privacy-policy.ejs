                    <strong>Slack Order Notify</strong> ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your
                    privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you
                    use our app. The app is designed to send notifications to your Slack workspace whenever a new order
                    is placed. By using the app, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>
                    We collect information to provide and improve our services. This includes personal information such
                    as your Slack Workspace ID, channel details where notifications are sent, and authentication tokens
                    provided when you connect your Slack workspace to the app. Additionally, we collect order-related
                    data such as order IDs, order totals, and customer names to generate and send notifications.
                    Technical data, such as IP addresses and usage statistics, may also be collected to ensure app
                    performance and security.
                </p>
                <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>
                    The information collected is used solely to enable the app's functionality and deliver real-time
                    notifications to your Slack workspace. We use the data to customize and optimize your notification
                    experience, monitor app performance, and enhance security. All information is handled responsibly to
                    ensure that the app operates as intended and meets your expectations.
                </p>
                <h2>3. How We Protect Your Information</h2>
                <p>
                    We prioritize the security of your data and use industry-standard measures to protect it. Sensitive
                    data, such as Slack authentication tokens, is encrypted, and access to information is restricted to
                    authorized personnel only. We implement secure data storage and transmission methods to prevent
                    unauthorized access or breaches.
                </p>
                <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
                <p>
                    We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties. The only exceptions
                    are cases where sharing is required by law or when integrating with Slack to deliver notifications,
                    following Slack’s API guidelines. By using the app, you also agree to Slack’s Privacy Policy.
                </p>
                <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>
                    We retain your information only for as long as it is necessary to provide the service or comply with
                    legal requirements. If you wish to disconnect the app from your Slack workspace or request the
                    deletion of your data, you can contact us at any time.
                </p>
                <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
                <p>
                    You have the right to access, update, or delete the data you have shared with us. Additionally, you
                    can withdraw your consent to use the app by disconnecting it from your Slack workspace. If you would like to exercise these rights, please reach out to us.
                </p>
                <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal obligations. Any updates will be posted on this page with a revised "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your data.
